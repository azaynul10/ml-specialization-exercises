[# 🤖 Machine Learning Specialization Exercises 🧠](https://giphy.com/clips/future-midjourney-chat-gpt-5CtAj3v1G9jLKwxM5E)

Welcome to my repository of exercises from the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) on Coursera! This specialization, created by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University, is taught by the legendary Andrew Ng. 

Throughout this hands-on specialization, I dive into the exciting world of machine learning, implementing algorithms and building models using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📚 Specialization Courses

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more!
   
   Linear Regression

2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms** 
   - Optimize your models with hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and more advanced techniques.
   
   Optimization

3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - Explore clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.
   
   Reinforcement Learning
